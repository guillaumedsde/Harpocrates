# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

The project was generated using the following command (note: you will need the actual path to the `openapi.yml` file):

```bash
openapi-generator generate -g python-flask -o api -i openapi.yml
```

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements

Python 3.5.2+

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python -m harpocrates_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:

```
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the **development** server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t harpocrates_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 harpocrates_server
```
